## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/X2W0dm7/Product-list-prew.png)

This pet project was made in order to consolidate the studied material.

A shopping cart is implemented in this project. You can add products to it and see the total amount of all added products. This project also implements sorting by title, prices and filtering by rating. And, of course, there is a product search in this project.
